## Using the traceroute command ##

Use the link below to install traceroute

Traceroute is used to trace a network packet as it travels your network. It can be used to troubleshoot network delays and errors

Try the following commands in the terminal by typing them in:

Command | Description
---------------------|----------------------------------------------------
`traceroute 8.8.8.8` | traces the route to google
`traceroute canvas.nbps.org` | traces the route to canvas
`traceroute 0.0.0.0` | trace route to an unspecified address


On a Windows operating system, `traceroute` would be replaced with `tracert`
