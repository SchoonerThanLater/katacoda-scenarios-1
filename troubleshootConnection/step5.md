## Using the tracepath command ##

`tracepath` is used to trace the path from origin to a destination. 

Try the following commands in the terminal by typing them in:

Command | Description
---------------------|----------------------------------------------------
`tracepath canvas.nbps.org` | trace the path to canvas
`tracepath -h`| show the options for tracepath

On a Windows operating system, `tracepath` would be replaced with `pathping`
